## Installing and using python simulation
#### 0. Installing poetry
<i>If you have [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) installed then skip this step.</i><br>
Windows: `pip install poetry`<br>
Unix based OS (Linux, macOS, etc.): `pip3 install poetry`

#### 1. Cloning repo and installing packages
```commandline
git clone https://github.com/Anvarys/virus-simulation/
cd virus-simulation
poetry install
```

#### 2. Running a simulation
```
poetry run python simulations/choose.py
```

### TODO:

1. Make 2d & 3d python simulations & visualise them ✅ (5 Nov)
2. Make X dimensional python simulation ✅ (5 Nov)
3. Add Graphics for X dimensional python simulation ✅ (5 Nov)
4. Web version of the 2d simulation ✅ (8 Nov)
5. Make it not ugly ✅ (9 Nov)
6. Publish web version via [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) ✅ (9 Nov)
7. Web version of X dimensional simulation ✅ (9 Nov)
8. Charts for X dimensional web simulation ✅ (10 Nov)
9. Web version of the 3d simulation (prob would crash any browser) ✅ (11 Nov)
10. Change simulations core to support multiple different viruses ✅ (12 Nov)
11. Add virus presets
12. Add a GUI to create different viruses

For Axiom I'm expecting to get to around 8th point in my TODO
UPD: Wow, I'm already done with 3D simulation (11 Nov)
